	// Once these are working, will need to add functions to merge complexes and perhaps others. Also, performing a choice will need to be able to pop a disassociation event back to the main system. Maybe do this with exceptions?
	// 11/24 JMS: I think I need to add a strand class in order to cleanly handle disassociation events for single strands. Disassociations that result in two seperate complexes needs to be handled as well, and efficiently. More thought required.
	// 11/25 JMS: Possibly the best thing to do is have the complex which performs the splitting choice return the new complex. If I implement strands, it should be easier to find the splitting point and construct the new complex efficiently.
