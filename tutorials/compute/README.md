This contains (commandline and otherwise) functions to compute common types of rates.

- dissociation.py is to compute dissociation rates directly.
- association.py is to compute hybridization rates and can infer dissociation
  rates based on pfunc in NUPACK.
- rate.py provides a commandline interface.
