To study how the branch migration progresses, we define intermediate structures and measure how much time the simulation spents in each of these states.

In the below, we define the initial structure,  in addition to structures with six, twelve and eightteen displaced base-pairs. \n",

In the loose macro states, only eight out of the seventy-two possible base-pairs are defined, and if any state includes at least six of those bounds, then it is in the set of matching states. In contrast, the exact macrostates have no wildcards and only when the simulation reaches that the exact state, a match is recorded."
