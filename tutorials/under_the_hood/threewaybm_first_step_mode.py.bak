# threewaybm_first_step_mode.py
#
# adapted from three_way_sims_example.py by Niranjan Srinivas and Joseph Schaeffer.
#
# This is the type of code used in the case studies... time to take a look at the innards...
# The main concept being shown here is the process for doing simulations in parallel on multicore machines.
# If you want a total number T of trajectories to be simulated, you can divide it into J jobs of S simulations each
# (with T = J*S) and then spawn off J instances of Multistrand, each of which creates and runs one SimSystem 
# that performs S simulation trials. The J jobs might not all be the same setup.  We demonstrate a simple batch scheduler
# that takes a list of jobs, counts the number of cores on your machine, and runs that many in parallel -- starting a new
# process whenever an old one completes. The results of each run are stored in data files in appropriately named
# directories "Data_toehold*" which can later be all loaded back and recombined into a single data set for each simulated
# system.  The analysis to extract rates from the simulations is similar to that in hybridization_first_step_mode.py,
# except that here we don't use Boltzmann sampling and we don't calculate error bars, which simplified things.
#
#
# Usage for a quick-running test using just toehold length 3 and a just a few trials, taking about 5 minutes:
# python -i threewaybm_first_step_mode.py test
#
# Usage for a full simulation with Metropolis kinetics and toehold lengths 1-4, about a 3 hours:
# python -i threewaybm_first_step_mode.py short
#
# Usage for a full simulation with Metropolis kinetics and toehold lengths 5-9, almost an hour:
# python -i threewaybm_first_step_mode.py medium
#
# Usage for a full simulation with Kawasaki kinetics and toehold 10-15, under half an hour:
# python -i threewaybm_first_step_mode.py long
#
# After the simulations are done, and you are dumped into interactive python, you can analyze the results:
# >>> final_results(3,"Metropolis")
#
# If you have already run the simulations, you can do the analysis for all toehold lengths:
# python -i threewaybm_first_step_mode.py analyze
#

# The following is somewhat general code for running a bunch of Multistrand simulations on as many cores as this computer has available.
# Directories "Data_toehold_*" are created and simulation results are stored there.
# When all the simulations are done, the data is all read back in, and processed together.
#
# Note the following important restriction:  all the simulations must use "the same energy model", that is, they must all request
# the same temperature, join_concentration, substrate_type (RNA vs DNA), dangles option, parameter_type (NUPACK vs Vienna),
# rate method (Kawasaki or Metropolis), and rate parameters (e.g. Calibrated, Unitary, etc).
# This is because all multithreaded parallel simulations will use the same energy/kinetics model.  The first one to run will initiallize
# the energy model, and all the rest will use it.  If the simulation script (e.g. actual_simunlation() below) were to call
# system.initialize_energy_model(o) -- either with the same conditions or different onese -- then the likely result would be
# a segmentation fault.  Don't do it.
