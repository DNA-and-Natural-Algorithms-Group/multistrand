# This example illustrates how to examine trajectories in multistranded simulations, 
# where association and dissociation can change the number and type of complexes.
# Pay attention to how, when that happens, the strand ordering can change,
# and thus dot-paren structures must be displayed differently.
#
# Try it like this, e.g.:
#   python -i hairpin_trajectories.py

# Some notes for the intrepid explorer: 

# The Options object and the SimSystem object are intimately tied, and after s.start() you can't just change energy model parameters or rate parameters.
# If you do, you need to tell Multistrand to update the energy model call, initialize_energy_model(o), and then make the SimSystem and start it.
# In the example, if these two simulations had used a different join_concentration, a different temperature, a different material (RNA vs DNA), 
# a different dangles option, a different parameter set (NUPACK vs Vienna), a different rate method (Kawasaki or Metropolis), or a different set of rate 
# scaling paramters (e.g. Calibrated, Unitary, etc), then we would need to use initialize_energy_model() in between.
# This is because all simulations share the same energy & kinetics model (which we just call the "energy model" for short)
# and it it not automatically re-adjusted after it has been created.  Note that "same energy model" means "the same sequence and secondary structure will get
# the same numerical value for the energy, and the same move will get the same rate" -- so, even though the underlying model may be the same, a change in, 
# e.g. concentration will imply a "different energy model" as we are using the term here.
#
# system.SimSystem(), system.calculate_energy(), system.calculate_rate() will all call initialize_energy_model() if none has been created yet,
# or else use the existing one even if the passed Options object specified different temperature or other parameters.  
# The onus is on the user to make sure this is all correct, if your code ever changes energy / kinetics parameters.  
# Basically, the only case where you *don't* need to update the energy model is if you change simulation mode, simulation time, start states, stop conditions,
# or number of simulations.
#
# This is a common source of mistakes, so why not always do it automatically?  The reason is so that Multistrand can efficiently exploit multicore processors
# and run with multiple threads, as shown in the threewaybm_first_step_mode.py example.  All threads share the energy model, and therefore we must not
# change the energy model when a new simulation starts but existing simulations are already running.  

# Also, once s.start() has run, you cannot run ('start') for this SimSystem again.  You must make a new Options object and a new SimSystem object.
# But if, in doing so, you changed energy/kinetics model parameters, you must also initialize_energy_model(o), as we've said.

# Note that if num_simulations > 1, then all the recorded states get collected together into the full_trajectory.  
# To tell where one trajectory stops and the next simulation starts, you can look at the time stamps.

# A good exercise to the reader, as a test of understanding: 
# you should be able to extract sequences & structures from trajectory, make a Complex of them, evaluate energy, start new simulation, etc.

# Trajectory like this were used in Schaeffer's MS thesis.
# Note that in the thesis, we displayed them in 5'->3' counterclockwise. Oops.
