##### TO DO: incorporate error calculations from hybridization_first_step_mode.py, and develop for the other cases.
#
# Again using hybridization of two short strands as an example, here we show that 
# multiple ways of extracting rate constants from Multistrand simulations give the 
# same result, at least if the system is simple enough that the model 
#   A + B -->{k_eff} C 
#       C -->{K_rev} A + B
# is appropriate.  We emphasize that only *short* strands can be studied this way,
# because simulations of the dissociation of long duplexes are prohibitively slow.
#
# Normally, k_eff should be the concentration-independent second-order bimolecular
# rate constant for association.  However, for sufficiently high concentrations, the
# unimolecular steps or unproductive interactions will be rate-limiting, and k_eff
# (inferred from data to fit the above model) will decrease.  Thus, for the general 
# case we consider k_eff to be a concentration-dependent approximation, in contrast
# to the more fundamental rate constants k1, k2, k1prime, k2prime derived in
# hybridization_first_step_mode.py.  
#
# We consider three ways to obtain k_eff.  
# 1.  First step mode.  Estimate more fundamental rate constants from unimolecular 
#     simulations of collisions, from which k_eff can be computed as a function of 
#     concentration.  This is the fastest.  See hybridization_first_step_mode.py 
#     for more explanation.
# 2.  First passage time simulations starting with (Boltzmann sampled) individual
#     strands within a concentration-dependent volume, wait for them to collide
#     as many times as necessary until a duplex is formed, and compute the rate
#     constant k_eff (for that concentration) from the average time.
# 3.  Transition mode simulations, where two strands are placed in a concentration-
#     dependent volume and simulated for a good long time as they hybridize and
#     fall apart again and again. Rate constants for both k_eff and k_rev are
#     estimated from the average times to transition from single-stranded to 
#     double-stranded macrostates (for k_eff) and back (for k_rev).
#
# There are also three ways to obtain k_rev.
# 1.  Trust the first step mode k_eff value, trust that a bimolecular model
#     is sufficient, so k_rev/k_eff = exp(dG/RT), and compute dG from the
#     NUPACK-predicted partition functions of the single strands and the duplex.
#     This is the fastest.
# 2.  First passage time simulations starting with the duplex state, stopping
#     when dissociation occurs.
# 3.  The same transition mode simulation described above.
#
# Although the calculations for these three methods are quite different, for a 
# suffient number of simulation trials they agree quite well.  Method 1 is faster
# than method 2 is faster than method 3.  (A proper comparison would also evaluate
# error bars, so that the amount of compute time required for a given level of accuracy
# is fairly compared.  We don't do that here.)
#
# A significant issue when using methods 2 and 3 is that, a priori, you won't know what 
# the critical concentration is, below which k_eff is constant.  (This value is usually 
# what you want.)  On the other hand, it is desirable to do first passage time and 
# transition mode simulations at a high concentration, so as not to waste time doing 
# simulations of single-stranded molecules just waiting for a collision to happen.  Practically,
# one must do a simulation at a high concentration, then decrease the concentration by a factor of
# two and perform another simulation, verifying that the estimated k_eff values don't change
# significantly.  First step mode simulations are not only faster, but they also obviate this
# concern by separately extracting the bimolecular (k1) and unimolecular (k2) rate constants.
#
# Try it like this, e.g.:
#   python -i hybridization_comparison.py
# The default 5-mer hybridization trials take about 10 minutes to complete.  
# Other options can be uncommented at the bottom of the file.
