# threewaybm_energies.py
#

# This example walks you through how to create multistranded complexes, how to find their energies, 
# and how to find the energy of a test tube state with multiple complexes at a chosen concentration (i.e. box volume).
# The example is toehold-initiated three-way branch migration, as per Zhang & Winfree, JACS, 2009.
# Some things are done in a rather long-winded way, just to illustrate the use of Multistrand.
# The intention is for you to try it line by line, and play around a bit.  E.g. use print() and help().
#
# Invoke as "python threewaybm_energies.py" to see a plot.
# Invoke as "python -i threewaybm_energies.py" to see a plot and then drop into the python interpreted to investigate further.
# Start python and "import threewaybm_energies as te" to calculate energies and steps as te.energies and te.steps, without making a plot.
# Start python and "from threewaybm_energies import *" to do the calculations and refer to the variables directly, as well as get access to the other imported functions.
# I use "ipython --pylab -i threewaybm_energies.py".
