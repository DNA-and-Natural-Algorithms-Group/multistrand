This folder contains the file required to generate the plots and tables of the hybridization case study in the Multistrand 2.0 journal version


Case 1: Table of Gao 2006 and the concentration-dependent rates and First Step mode comparison
Case 2: Scatterplots of association and dissociation rates for randomized and Gao 2006 sequences
Case 3: Heathmap for hybridization states



To test these files, try

barplots 		(no arguments)
case1.py plots 160
case1.py slowDownStudy 1200
case2.py generate iso-random 15 10 ir15-10
case3.py 2 24 test2

By default these scripts will spawn multiple compute threads
