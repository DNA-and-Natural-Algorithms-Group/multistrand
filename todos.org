*** PENDING [#A] [[file:Makefile][Makefile]]    [1/4]
**** TODO way too much in the way of connected dependencies, see if we can remove some of the crossed ones, especially scomplex.h and loop.h
     Can generate all these via simple scripts, e.g.: "grep loop.h
     */*" with appropriate flags for filename of matches only.

        May not be necessary, new makefile format is a lot cleaner than before.
***** TODO sanity check
**** PENDING [[file:Makefile::TODO][documentation]]
**** More components for [[Makefile][Makefile]] TODO List [/]
***** TODO revisit the python_interface necessity for PYTHON_THREADS
***** TODO Add make target for embedded multistrand (current default is the standalone, with python options object)
***** TODO Update objects / sources / clean up other things.
**** DONE Primary targets work: all, python-interface
     All works fine, python-interface works up to boost errors.

*** DONE [[file:energymodel/energymodel.cc][energymodel.cc]]
    Chopped out all the commented energy model code that was split
    into separate files. This means the file boils down to just the
    constructors we had in the energy model before, as they can't be
    virtual. The destructor is virtual but not pure. If you ever hit
    it though, something is odd.
