      It's no longer called python_interface, and is just "interface",

*** DONE [[file:energymodel/energymodel.cc][energymodel.cc]]
    Chopped out all the commented energy model code that was split
    into separate files. This means the file boils down to just the
    constructors we had in the energy model before, as they can't be
    virtual. The destructor is virtual but not pure. If you ever hit
    it though, something is odd.
