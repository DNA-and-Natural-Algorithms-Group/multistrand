      All macros have a debug version now, with a few exceptions: All
      List references and list accessors are the caller's
      responsibility to check whether the return value was
      invalid. All string functions are also caller's responsibility.

      Currently usable, rest is managing dependencies and so
      on. Remaining features for later work. 
**** TODO way too much in the way of connected dependencies, see if we can remove some of the crossed ones, especially scomplex.h and loop.h
     Can generate all these via simple scripts, e.g.: "grep loop.h
     */*" with appropriate flags for filename of matches only.

****** TODO Sourcefiles:
       Most still need checking for includes of type "../include/",
       which is no longer needed.
***** DONE revisit the python_interface necessity for PYTHON_THREADS
      It's no longer called python_interface, and is just "interface",
      which is the collection of c++ and python objects for using
      Multistrand via an interface rather than standalone. This is
      likely where options should go as well.

***** DONE Add make target for embedded multistrand (current default is the standalone, with python options object)
      Added make target "interface" which builds the multistrand.so
      file for use in a python interpreted session. Cleaned up this
      function dramatically.

       No longer needed, sub directories are managed via the main Makefile in a clean way. See other notes re: that implementation.

***** TODO sanity check
**** DONE Primary targets work: all, python-interface
     All works fine, python-interface works up to boost errors.

*** DONE [[file:energymodel/energymodel.cc][energymodel.cc]]
    Chopped out all the commented energy model code that was split
    into separate files. This means the file boils down to just the
    constructors we had in the energy model before, as they can't be
    virtual. The destructor is virtual but not pure. If you ever hit
    it though, something is odd.
