Release 2.1 changelog:

	- Moved to c++11 standard.
	- Reworked c++ internals: new files, classes, structs, enums, consts and various tostrings added. For example: struct BaseCount instead of int[] for storing exposed bases in a complex or loop. Settings imported from Python are now cached.
	- Many files that were no longer relevant or not working are now removed. Multistrand no longer supports the ViennaRNA thermodynamic model. 
	- Tests of long-run equilibrium and equivalence of the energy model (w.r.t. NUPACK) are now working.
	- SimSystem objects now supports .initialInfo(), which prints the internal representation of the initial state (also see /tutorials/misc/inspection.py).
	- Fixed a bug (pointer comparison) that prevented deterministic execution.
	- Fixed a bug that required the user to rename parameter files when simulating RNA.
	- Multistrand now ships with convenience classes for multithreading (interface/concurrent.py -- various demos, for example tutorials/misc/computeAnnealRate.py).
	- Multistrand will now complain when the user does not explicitly set the uni- and bi-molecular rate constants, before setting them automatically (as before). Default parameterization is provided in multistrand.utils.
	- Multistrand now prints a warning when no initial moves are available in first step mode. 
	- Multistrand now prints a warning when the simulation time is exceeded, but no stopping condition is met (provided they are set).
	- Multistrand now creates a logfile (multistrandRun.log) containing some of the simulation details. This file is overwritten each time a simulation is started.
	- Now supports buffer conditions (see f.a.q.).
	- Updated documentation.
	- Updated the installation guidelines.
	- Removed unused code from the installation files.
	- Added case study files for hybridization (tutorials/hybridization_casestudy).
	- Added a case study on leak rates (tutorials/leak_casestudy).
	- Added a function that generates a unique (hashable) value for each visited state (see tutorials/misc/uniqueID.py).
	- Added a commandline utility (and tutorial file) to compute hybridization rates (tutorials/misc/computeAnnealRate.py).
	- Convenience functions for standard experimental setups are available in multistrand.experiment (for example multistrand.experiment.hybridization(multistrand.Options(), string:sequence) -- also see computeAnnealRate.py)
	
	As of Jul 2017:
	- Added support for nupack 3.2.1
	
	As of Aug 2017:
	- Expanding the leak case study (Mirnank Sharma), added FirstStepLeak object to handle leak simulations in concurrent.py (FD and MS).
	- An OS X bugfix.
	- Added error messages for object initialization (Mirnank Sharma).
	- Added compute folder for (commandline) utility in tutorials
	- Removed unused code in make files and initialization routine. 
	- Added files for simulating Machinek - Turberfield mismatch paper
	
	
Known issues in Multistrand 2.1:

	- Because multithreading is handled outside the C++ core, error messages print once for each thread.
