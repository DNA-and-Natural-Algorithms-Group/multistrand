Release 2.1 changelog:

	- Reworked c++ internals: new files, classes, structs, enums, consts and various tostrings added. Moved to the c++11 standard.
	- Many files that were longer relevant or not working well are now removed. Depreciated support for ViennaRNA. 
	- Tests of long-run equilibrium and equivalence of the energy model (w.r.t. NUPACK) are now working.
	- SimSystem objects now supports .initialInfo(), which prints the internal representation of the initial state.
	- Fixed a bug that prevented Multistrand from executing deterministically.
	- Fixed a bug that required the user to rename parameter files when simulating RNA. 
	- Multistrand now ships with convience classes for multithreading (interface/concurrent.py).
	- Multistrand will now complain when the user does not explicity set the uni- and bi-molecular rate constants. Defaults are provided in multistrand.utils.
	- Multistrand will let the user know when no initial moves are available in first step mode. 
	
	
Known issues in Multistrand 2.1:

	- Because multithreading is handeled outside C++ core, error messages print once for each thread.
